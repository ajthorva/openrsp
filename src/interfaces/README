There should be the following files:

interface_host_openrsp.F90
interface_openrsp_xc.F90
interface_openrsp_1el.F90
interface_openrsp_2el.F90
interface_openrsp_rsp_solver.F90

Program specifics should be minimized.  Using common blocks is convenient for
the quick hack but in the long term it is like nuclear waste.  Please always
think about others who are working on other codes where the infrastructure of
your code is simply not there.

Never access data directly, only through get functions.
